# decay-predictor
Use the [semi-empirical mass formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula) to calculate approximate nuclear binding energies. From there, explore how possible decay paths would affect binding energy, and use this information to predict which decays will occur.
